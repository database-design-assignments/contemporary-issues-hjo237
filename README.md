# Private information Usage in Database System
In this document,  I would like to discuss about different views in using private information in Database System. The matter of using private information as a data can be a controversial issue.  

## Article 1  
In New York Times article [Clearview AI’s Facial Recognition App Called Illegal in Canada]("https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/03/technology/clearview-ai-illegal-canada.html"), it explains how using people's face for Face Recognition App is illegal in Canada. According to the article, Canada is claiming the Clearview AI is doing an illegal act since they are using people's face without their consent. However, Clearview AI are claiming that this should not be a problem because they used faces that are already publicly available: they scrapped faces from social media networks and other public websites.  

Both side's claims are reasonable, but I think it will be not easy to delete all the Canadian's face only as said in the article. Because there are already so many faces saved in their database, it should be hard to choose out Canadian's face just by looking at their face alone, and to delete all of them. It would also not be easy for the individuals with their faces on to request to delete them. They might not even care about their faces on the Clearview AI database. In either way, it is a sensitive issue: to what extent the privacy law applies. 

## Article 2  
Contrary to how private informations stored as a data is being a problem, having a personal information as a data can also help the society. In Bloomberg's article [How DNA Databases Deter Crime]("https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-01/dna-databases-are-better-crime-deterrent-than-long-prison-time"), it claims that having people's DNA database can reduce the criminal rate. According to the natural experiment in Denmark, "adding people charged with a felony to Denmark’s DNA database reduced the likelihood of another conviction within the following year by a whopping 42%."

I believe this can be a good way to reduce the crime. With a development in technology, we have improved the way to catch criminals, and there are no reason to not use this technology. Some might say that privacy can be an issue, but since we are saving DNA Database of people who already commmited crime, there are valid reasons for saving their private information. Also, as noted in the article, putting criminals in jail, and recording places with cameras to prevent crime also violates privacy. DNA database has smaller privacy violation than what we did in the past to prevent crime.
